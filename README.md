# 🏥 Convenience Care

**Convenience Care** is an **online health record management system** that enables individuals to securely store and manage their personal medical histories. The platform also features a **disease prediction module** that provides early insights into potential health risks based on the user’s symptoms.

---

## 🎯 Features
- 🧑‍⚕️ **User Authentication** — Register and log in securely.
- 📝 **Health Records Management** — Digitally store, view, and update personal health records.
- 🔮 **Disease Prediction** — Get basic predictions of potential health conditions using a machine learning model.
- 📂 **Multi-folder Organization** — `Codes` and `MiniProject` directories to keep core modules and supporting files separate.
- 💡 **Exportable Database Dumps** — SQL dumps in the `dumps/` folder for easy database setup and restoration.
